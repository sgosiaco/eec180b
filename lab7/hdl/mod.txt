modified stuff from past working
    added default state to try and get it to compile as a state machine
    changed sensitivity list on always block for state machine
    changed 2nd set of reads to use rd_in_r instead of rd_in

    fixed huge ass bug of not having the dimensions on the output variables
        wr_addr, wr_data, rd_addr

    probably have to change data modified in state machine to registers
        like balance from last lab

    currently trying out adding defaults back instead of making them registers


    maybe remove reset from memory????
    simulation demo change divideby number for the pulse clock to make it run faster
